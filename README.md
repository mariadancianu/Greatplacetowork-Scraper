## Status
Project is: *in progress*. 

## Warnings
The websites structure changes in time and a Web Scraper that was previously working perfectly can break due to these updates. The code must be maintained and updated by running periodical tests. Small adjustments are usually required since the websites changes are small and incremental. I will try to update the code periodically but keep in mind that any errors are part of the Web Scraping process.
